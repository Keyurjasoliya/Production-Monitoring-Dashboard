# ðŸ“Š Production Monitoring Dashboard

A data-driven Power BI dashboard that enables **real-time monitoring of key production metrics**, helping factories optimize performance and drive operational efficiency.

---

### ðŸ”§ Features
- Live visualization of **OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)**
- Shift-wise analysis of **downtime**, **availability**, **performance**, and **quality**
- Integration with **SQL backend** for automated data feeds
- Simulation of factory sensor data using **Python**
- Clear, interactive dashboards for operators and managers

---

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Power BI** â€“ Dashboard and data modeling  
- **SQL** â€“ Backend data storage and queries  
- **Python** â€“ Data simulation and pre-processing  
- **Excel** â€“ Template for importing test data  
- **Lean Manufacturing** â€“ Principles guiding KPI structure

### ðŸ“ˆ Use Case
This project is ideal for:
- **Production engineers** looking to digitize KPI tracking  
- **Operations teams** needing shift performance breakdowns  
- **Continuous improvement teams** identifying bottlenecks

---

### ðŸš€ How It Works
1. Simulated sensor data is generated using Python
2. Data is stored in a structured SQL database
3. Power BI connects to the database for dynamic visualization
4. KPIs are calculated in real-time and displayed with filters for shift, line, and date
